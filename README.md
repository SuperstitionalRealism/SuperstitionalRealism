## Superstitional Realism
Hello! My name is Realism

Adult | She/He | Lesbian

Ponytown regiments are my special interest. PLEASE ask me about them if you see me online, or leave me something in my ata-book!

I've been in the community since 2020 and I could discuss various regiment topics for hours. 

I wrote a basic guidebook on regiments! I'd love if you gave it a look, especially if you're a new player or don't know too much about regiments. Even if you don't plan getting involved in the community, it has some information to provide you with some general knowledge on the community. 

I'm always avaliable to cuddle with or hide behind. I'm usually off tab or AFK at docks but I frequently check my whispers. I have no DNI, if I don't want to interact, I'll just block you

I don't bite! Come say hi

Watch Horse Race Tests, play Umamusume, binge My Little Pony, listen to horsegiirL, always bet on losing horses, join a regiment
