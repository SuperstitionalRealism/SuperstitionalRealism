## Superstitional Realism | BASIC REGIMENT GUIDEBOOK LINKED UNDER MY PROFILE.
Hello! My name is Superstitional Realism but you can call me Realism for short.

Adult | She/He | Lesbian | Horse

☆ Ponytown regiments are my special interest. PLEASE ask me about them if you see me online or leave me something in my ata-book! Feel free to ask for advice, ask my opinions on regimental topics or specific groups, ask my opinion on certain controversies/situations/issues, start a RESPECTFUL debate with me, tell me about your own regiment experiences or memories (good or bad), or just leave a kind message. I respond to every message I get on my ata-book, even if it takes a couple of days. I like to put thought into my responses and be very mindful about what I say. 

☆ I've been in the community since 2020 and I could discuss various regiment topics for hours. I no longer actively participate in regiments unless one particularly interests me, but I'm open to assisting regiments who are trying to start up or any regimental projects in general. My DMs are also always open to discuss regimental topics or situations in depth. I love helping out where I can. 

☆ Despite my very strong opinions on certain matters, I am always happy to recieve constructive criticism and feedback. I like to think I'm a very open-minded person and if I have a differing viewpoint on something than you, I don't understand something, or only have one side of a story, please feel free to educate me. I'm always willing to have respectful discussions and debates about things. 

☆ I want to stay on good or neutral terms with everyone in the community if I can help it. I don't actively enjoy being caught in "drama" and I will do my best to be a neutral third party in any situations that arise. Most situations and topics are not black and white and I am not someone who will usually "choose sides", especially if I have been thoroughly informed on all sides of an issue. I will formulate my own opinions about things based on my own resarch and experiences. I will be honest about a situation and I'm not afraid to tell you if I believe you were in the wrong about something. However, I also know I'm not always correct and I can make mistakes and poor decisions sometimes, just like any other human being. If I ever say or do anything wrong or offensive or I make you uncomfortable or upset, PLEASE address it with me right away. If I do wrong by anybody, I want to take responsiblty for it and make it right however I'm able.

☆ As long as you are not a predator, someone who carries hateful ideologies, or someone who is undeniably proven to be actively malicious, I am willing to communicate with you. Even if we disagree on big issues, even if we don't get along, even if I hate your guts and want nothing to do with you, I will still ALWAYS hear you out, I will still ALWAYS listen to general feedback and criticism from you, I will still ALWAYS be willing to give you advice, and I will still ALWAYS be willing to discuss any topics with you. No matter how much I dislike a person or group, I will always try to give them credit where credit is due. I try to be fair and honest even if I don't support a person's actions or behavior. If I see misinformation going around about a person or group, even if I despise them, I will do my best to clear it up. As long as you aren't a hateful and evil person deep down in your heart, I will be civil and decent to you.

☆ I wrote a basic guidebook on regiments! I'd love if you gave it a look, especially if you're a new player or don't know too much about regiments. Even if you don't plan getting involved in the community, it has some information to provide you with some general knowledge on the community. 

☆ I don't bite! Come say hi. I'm always avaliable to cuddle with or hide behind. I'm usually off tab or AFK at docks but I frequently check my whispers and ata-book. I have no DNI, if I don't want to interact, I'll just block you. There are only two people on the entire platform I am forbidden from speaking to and if you're reading this, there's a 99.9% chance you are not one of them.

☆ Watch Horse Race Tests, play Umamusume, binge My Little Pony, listen to horsegiirL, always bet on losing horses, join a regiment.
